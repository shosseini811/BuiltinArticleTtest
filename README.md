# How to do a T-Test in Python

## Introduction
The t-test is a common statistical method used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. In the field of statistics and data analysis, t-tests are widely used to compare sample populations and infer conclusions about the larger population. In this article, we will discuss the assumptions of a t-test, its benefits when using Python, and how to perform various types of t-tests in Python with examples. We will also provide troubleshooting tips for using t-tests in Python.

## Section 1: What are the assumptions of a T-Test?
A t-test is based on several assumptions that need to be met for the results to be valid. Violations of these assumptions may lead to incorrect conclusions. These assumptions are:

### Independence of observations
The data points in each group should be independent of each other. This means that the outcome of one observation should not affect the outcome of another observation. Independence can be achieved by using random sampling or experimental designs that account for potential confounding factors. In cases where independence cannot be assumed, alternative tests such as mixed-effects models or repeated measures ANOVA may be more appropriate.

### Normality
The data should follow a normal distribution in each group. Normality can be visually assessed using histograms or quantile-quantile (QQ) plots, or tested using formal tests such as the Shapiro-Wilk test or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. However, t-tests are relatively robust to violations of normality when the sample size is large. For small sample sizes or severely non-normal data, non-parametric alternatives such as the Mann-Whitney U test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test can be used.

### Equal variances
The variances of the two groups should be approximately equal, although there are variations of the t-test that can handle unequal variances. To assess the equality of variances, you can use graphical methods like box plots, or perform a formal test like Levene's test or Bartlett's test. If the variances are not equal, a Welch's t-test can be used as it does not assume equal variances.

If these assumptions are not met, the results of the t-test may not be reliable. In these cases, it may be necessary to use a non-parametric test, which does not make these assumptions.

T-tests are a powerful tool for comparing the means of two groups. However, it is important to make sure that the assumptions of the test are met before using it.

## Section 2: Benefits of using a T-Test in Python
Using Python for t-tests offers several benefits:
- Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that can be used for a variety of tasks, including data analysis.
- There are many libraries available for Python that make it easy to perform t-tests.
- T-tests can be performed quickly and easily in Python.
- The results of t-tests can be easily visualized in Python.


## Section 3: Sample T-Test with the Iris Dataset in Python
To demonstrate the use of a t-test, we will use the famous "Iris" dataset available in the Seaborn library. The Iris dataset contains information on 150 iris flowers from three different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica), with 50 samples from each species. The dataset has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

### Sub-section 3: Steps to Calculate

In this example, we will perform a t-test to compare the mean petal lengths of Iris setosa and Iris versicolor.

1. Import the necessary libraries:
   ```python
   import seaborn as sns
   import numpy as np
   from scipy import stats
2. Load the Iris dataset:
   ```python
   iris = sns.load_dataset('iris')
3. Filter the dataset for the two species we want to compare:
   ```python
   setosa = iris[iris['species'] == 'setosa']
   versicolor = iris[iris['species'] == 'versicolor']
4. Extract the petal lengths for each species:
   ```python
   setosa_petal_lengths = setosa['petal_length']
   versicolor_petal_lengths = versicolor['petal_length']
5. Perform the t-test:
   ```python
   t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(setosa_petal_lengths, versicolor_petal_lengths)
6. Interpret the results:
   ```python
   alpha = 0.05
   if p_value < alpha:
       print("Reject the null hypothesis; there is a significant difference between the petal lengths of Iris setosa and Iris versicolor.")
   else:
       print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis; there is no significant difference between the petal lengths of Iris setosa and Iris versicolor.")

This t-test compares the mean petal lengths of Iris setosa and Iris versicolor. The obtained p-value, which is approximately `5.40e-62` indicates that there is a significant difference between the two species.

## Section 4: Sample T-Test with tips dataset in Python 
### Sub-section 4: Steps to Calculate
In this example, we will use the built-in "tips" dataset available in the Seaborn library. The tips dataset contains information about the total bill amount, tip amount, gender, smoker status, day, time, and size of the party for different meals at a restaurant.

We will perform a t-test to compare the mean total bill amounts for lunch and dinner.
1. Import the necessary libraries:
   ```python
   import seaborn as sns
   import numpy as np
   from scipy import stats
2. Load the tips dataset:
   ```python
   tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')

3. Filter the dataset for lunch and dinner:
   ```python
   lunch = tips[tips['time'] == 'Lunch']
   dinner = tips[tips['time'] == 'Dinner']
4. Extract the total bill amounts for lunch and dinner:
   ```python
   lunch_total_bills = lunch['total_bill']
   dinner_total_bills = dinner['total_bill']
5. Perform the t-test:
   ```python
   t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(lunch_total_bills, dinner_total_bills)
6. Interpret the results:
   ```python
   alpha = 0.05
   if p_value < alpha:
       print("Reject the null hypothesis; there is a significant difference between the total bill amounts for lunch and dinner.")
   else:
       print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis; there is no significant difference between the total bill amounts for lunch and dinner.")

This t-test compares the mean total bill amounts for lunch and dinner, and  the obtained p-value, which is approximately `0.0041` indicates there is a significant difference between the two meal times.

## Section 5: Paired T-Test in Python
### Sub-Section 5: Steps to Calculate
In this section, we will perform a paired t-test to compare the mean pulse rate of subjects before and after the exercise of type "rest" using Python. The following steps outline the process:
1. Import the necessary libraries:
   ```python
   import seaborn as sns
   import numpy as np
   from scipy import stats

2. Load the exercise dataset:
   ```python
   exercise = sns.load_dataset('exercise')
3. Filter the dataset for exercise type "rest":
   ```python
   rest_exercise = exercise[exercise['kind'] == 'rest']

4. Convert the 'time' column to an integer (in minutes) for comparison purposes:
   ```python
   rest_exercise['time'] = rest_exercise['time'].apply(lambda x: int(x.split()[0]))
5. Sort and reset the index for the rest_exercise DataFrame:
   ```python
   rest_exercise_sorted = rest_exercise.sort_values(['id', 'time']).reset_index(drop=True)
6. Extract the pulse rates before and after the exercise:
   ```python
   before_exercise_pulse = rest_exercise_sorted[rest_exercise_sorted['time'] == 1]['pulse']
   after_exercise_pulse = rest_exercise_sorted[rest_exercise_sorted['time'] == 15]['pulse']
7. Perform the paired t-test:
   ```python
   t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_rel(before_exercise_pulse.values, after_exercise_pulse.values)
   
8. Print the p-value for the paired t-test:
   ```python
   print("p-value for paired t-test: ", p_value)
  
In this case, the p-value 0.1914 is greater than the alpha 0.05, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is no significant difference in the mean pulse rate of subjects before and after the "rest" exercise.

## Section 6: Troubleshooting Tips for Using T-Test in Python

- **Check data assumptions**: Ensure that your data meets the assumptions of the t-test before proceeding with the analysis. If your data violates any of the assumptions, consider using alternative statistical tests.
- **Handle missing values**: Remove or impute missing values in your dataset before performing the t-test. Missing values can lead to inaccurate results.
- **Verify the data type**: Ensure that the data type of your input is correct. For example, using a list instead of a NumPy array can lead to errors.
- **Interpret p-values cautiously**: Always consider the context of your study when interpreting p-values. A low p-value indicates that the results are statistically significant but does not prove causality or the practical significance of the difference.
- **Use appropriate libraries**: Utilize libraries like SciPy and NumPy to simplify the process of performing a t-test and other statistical analyses in Python.
