# How to do a T-Test in Python

## Introduction
The t-test is a common statistical method used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. In this article, we will discuss the assumptions of a t-test, its benefits when using Python, and how to perform various types of t-tests in Python with examples. We will also provide troubleshooting tips for using t-tests in Python.

## Section 1: What are the assumptions of a T-Test?
A t-test is based on several assumptions that need to be met for the results to be valid. These assumptions are:
- Independence of observations: The data points in each group should be independent of each other.
- Normality: The data should follow a normal distribution in each group. However, t-tests are relatively robust to violations of normality when the sample size is large.
- Equal variances: The variances of the two groups should be approximately equal, although there are variations of the t-test that can handle unequal variances.

## Section 2: Benefits of using a T-Test in Python
Using Python for t-tests offers several benefits:
- Open-source: Python is a free, open-source programming language, which makes it accessible to everyone.
- Easy to learn: Python has a simple syntax and is widely considered one of the easiest programming languages to learn.
- Extensive libraries: Python offers various libraries, such as SciPy and NumPy, which simplify complex mathematical and statistical calculations.
- Reproducibility: Python code is easy to share, allowing others to reproduce your analysis and build upon your work.

## Section 3: Sample T-Test in Python Example 1
In this example, we'll perform an independent samples t-test comparing the average heights of two groups: Group A and Group B.

### Sub-section 3: Steps to Calculate
To demonstrate the use of a t-test, we will use the famous "Iris" dataset available in the Seaborn library. The Iris dataset contains information on 150 iris flowers from three different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica), with 50 samples from each species. The dataset has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

In this example, we will perform a t-test to compare the mean petal lengths of Iris setosa and Iris versicolor.

1. Import the necessary libraries:
   ```python
   import seaborn as sns
   import numpy as np
   from scipy import stats
