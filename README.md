# How to do a T-Test in Python

## Introduction
The t-test is a common statistical method used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. In this article, we will discuss the assumptions of a t-test, its benefits when using Python, and how to perform various types of t-tests in Python with examples. We will also provide troubleshooting tips for using t-tests in Python.

## Section 1: What are the assumptions of a T-Test?
A t-test is based on several assumptions that need to be met for the results to be valid. These assumptions are:
- Independence of observations: The data points in each group should be independent of each other.
- Normality: The data should follow a normal distribution in each group. However, t-tests are relatively robust to violations of normality when the sample size is large.
- Equal variances: The variances of the two groups should be approximately equal, although
